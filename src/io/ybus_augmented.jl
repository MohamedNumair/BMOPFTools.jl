# io/ybus_augmented.jl
#
# Augmented (bordered, MNA-style) system nodal admittance matrix.
#
# Extends the passive Ybus with linear constraint rows for IDEAL couplings —
# elements with no finite admittance form: closed switches (optionally) and
# zero-leakage transformers with a non-unity ratio (which `ybus_passive` can
# only stamp as a singular shunt-only block). Each coupling contributes one
# auxiliary current unknown `w` and one constraint row `a·V = 0`, giving the
# bordered system
#
#     K = [ Y   Aᵀ ]      K · [V; w] = [I_inj; 0]
#         [ A   0  ],
#
# where `Y` is the passive Ybus over the surviving nodes and `A` stacks the
# per-conductor constraint rows. The same (real-coefficient) vector is stamped
# as row AND column, so `K = transpose(K)` — the module-wide reciprocity
# convention (see ybus.jl: plain transpose, never the adjoint) is preserved,
# and the ideal element is exact: the constraint holds identically, with no
# penalty-admittance conditioning error, and the coupling current comes out as
# a first-class solution unknown.
#
# Constraint rows are scaled by a nominal admittance `y0` (the median passive
# diagonal magnitude) so the voltage-dimension rows are commensurate with the
# siemens-dimension KCL rows; the physical coupling current is `scale·w`.
#
# Ideal-transformer constraint rows are built from `_xfmr_winding_incidence`,
# the SAME seam the Yprim builders use — the constraint c·V = 0 with
# c = C_w1 − ratio·C_w2 is exactly the zero-leakage limit of the rank-1 series
# block yt·transpose(c)·c, so the admittance and constraint paths cannot drift.

    IdealCoupling

One ideal coupling (per conductor / winding core) in an [`AugYbusResult`](@ref):
a linear constraint `Σ coeffs[k]·V[nodes[k]] = 0` with an auxiliary current
unknown occupying one bordered row/column of `K`.

Fields:
- `kind`      — `:switch` (closed switch conductor) or `:ideal_xfmr`
                (zero-leakage winding core).
- `id`        — element id; `"subtype/id"` for transformers.
- `conductor` — conductor / winding-core index within the element.
- `nodes`     — system node indices (earth-referenced entries already dropped;
                aliased terminals resolved to their representative).
- `coeffs`    — constraint coefficients: ±1 for switches, the winding
                incidence `C_w1 − ratio·C_w2` for ideal transformers.
- `scale`     — conditioning scale applied to the stamped row/column; the
                PHYSICAL coupling current is `scale · w`, where `w` is the
                bordered-row solution entry. Oriented so the coupling draws
                `scale·w·coeffs[k]` out of node `nodes[k]`.

    AugYbusResult

Augmented system nodal admittance matrix (see [`ybus_augmented`](@ref)).

Fields:

                nodes and `m` couplings, `K = transpose(K)`. The leading `n×n`

- `nodes`     — `Vector{Tuple{String,String}}`, node order of the leading block

- `index`     — `Dict{Tuple{String,String},Int}` from any `(bus, terminal)` to

- `couplings` — `Vector{IdealCoupling}`, in bordered-row order.

                   switches=:alias, ideal_xfmrs=:constrain) -> AugYbusResult

Assemble the augmented (bordered, MNA-style) system nodal admittance matrix:
the passive Ybus of [`ybus_passive`](@ref) extended with one constraint row and
auxiliary current unknown per ideal coupling, `K·[V; w] = [I_inj; 0]`.

Keywords:
- `switches = :alias | :constrain` — `:alias` (default) fuses closed-switch
  terminals into shared nodes exactly like `ybus_passive`; `:constrain` keeps
  them distinct and ties them per conductor with `V_from − V_to = 0` rows, so
  each switch-conductor current is a solution unknown. Both modes yield
  identical node voltages.
- `ideal_xfmrs = :constrain | :stamp` — `:constrain` (default) models every
  zero-leakage, NON-unity-ratio two-winding transformer (`single_phase`,
  `wye_delta`, `delta_wye`) exactly, as ideal winding-core constraints
  `u_w1 − ratio·u_w2 = 0` from [`_xfmr_winding_incidence`](@ref); `:stamp`
  falls back to `ybus_passive`'s singular shunt-only block (with its warning).
  Unity-ratio zero-leakage transformers stay node-aliased in either mode
  (an exact identity — strictly better than a constraint).

The constraint coefficients must be real (they are, for all supported
subtypes — ratios are `v_nom` quotients times a real tap); this keeps
`K = transpose(K)`. A degenerate coil ratio (zero/non-finite, e.g. `tap = 0`)
raises an `ArgumentError`.

Non-source shunt-only networks aside, `K` is nonsingular whenever every node
group has a path to a voltage reference; islands and floating ideal deltas
surface as singular factorizations in the consuming solver, not here.
