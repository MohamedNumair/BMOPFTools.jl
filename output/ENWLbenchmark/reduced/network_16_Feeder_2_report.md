## 7. Provenance & Model Conventions

**Inferred convention:** LV_240V: 4-wire; 1 grounding point(s)

| Voltage level | Wires | Buses with neutral |
|---------------|-------|-------------------:|
| LV_240V | 4-wire | 149 / 149 |

| Neutral grounding | Value |
|-------------------|------:|
| Buses with neutral | 149 |
| Neutral branches | 148 |
| Grounding points | 1 |
| Neutral sections | 1 |
| Floating sections | 0 |

**Linecode impedance classification:**

| Verdict | Count |
|---------|------:|
| distinct | 5 |

**OpenDSS default fingerprints:** none detected ✓

**Earthing system per galvanic zone:**

| Zone | Buses | Wires | Star point | Downstream earths | Likely system |
|------|------:|-------|------------|------------------:|---------------|
| 240.0 V | 149 | 4-wire | solid | 0 | TN-S or TT (source-earthed only — protective-earth side not representable in the data model) |

> 🔵 **[I.PROV.NO_PI_SHUNT]** All 5 linecode(s) have no π-shunt admittance (G_from/B_from/G_to/B_to absent or zero) — the line model reduces to a series impedance only. Shunt capacitance is typically negligible for short LV cables but may be significant for long MV/HV lines.

## 8. Spec Conformance & Benchmark Readiness

| Spec conformance | Value |
|------------------|------:|
| Conformance issues | 0 |
| Voltage sources (spec requires 1) | 1 |

| Structural integrity | Value |
|----------------------|------:|
| Reference issues | 0 |
| Dimension issues | 0 |
| Galvanic islands | 1 |
| Islands without voltage reference | 0 |
| Line impedance spread | 40.2× |

| Benchmark readiness | Value |
|---------------------|------:|
| Objective well-posed | true |
| Only slack generation | false |
| Buses with \|V\| bounds | 0.0% |
| Buses with vpn / vpp / vpos bounds | 148 / 0 / 0 |
| Lines with thermal limits | 100.0% |
| Generators with no DOF (p\_min≈p\_max) | 0 |
| Generators with zero cost (dispatchable) | 0 |
| Same-cost generator pairs (≤1 hop) | 0 |
| Loads with zero p\_nom | 0 |

**Augmentation needed:**

- no voltage magnitude bounds on any bus — voltage is unconstrained; add v_min/v_max (phase-to-ground)
