> 🔵 **[I.PRE.NO_VOLT_BOUNDS]** 4080 bus(es) have no voltage bounds — voltage will be unconstrained at these buses.
> 🔵 **[I.PRE.SINGLE_SOURCE]** Network has a single voltage source — single point of failure. Infeasibility of the source makes the entire network infeasible.

## 7. Provenance & Model Conventions

**Inferred convention:** LV_240V: 4-wire; 1 grounding point(s)

| Voltage level | Wires | Buses with neutral |
|---------------|-------|-------------------:|
| LV_240V | 4-wire | 4080 / 4080 |

| Neutral grounding | Value |
|-------------------|------:|
| Buses with neutral | 4080 |
| Neutral branches | 4079 |
| Grounding points | 1 |
| Neutral sections | 1 |
| Floating sections | 0 |

**Linecode impedance classification:**

| Verdict | Count |
|---------|------:|
| distinct | 8 |

**OpenDSS default fingerprints:** 2 hit(s) — see findings

**Earthing system per galvanic zone:**

| Zone | Buses | Wires | Star point | Downstream earths | Likely system |
|------|------:|-------|------------|------------------:|---------------|
| 240.0 V | 4080 | 4-wire | solid | 0 | TN-S or TT (source-earthed only — protective-earth side not representable in the data model) |

> 🔵 **[I.PROV.NO_PI_SHUNT]** All 8 linecode(s) have no π-shunt admittance (G_from/B_from/G_to/B_to absent or zero) — the line model reduces to a series impedance only. Shunt capacitance is typically negligible for short LV cables but may be significant for long MV/HV lines.
> 🔵 **[I.PROV.DSS_DEFAULT_LENGTH]** 2 of 4079 line(s) have length exactly 1.0 among otherwise varied lengths — the OpenDSS default; these lengths were likely never set.

## 8. Spec Conformance & Benchmark Readiness

| Spec conformance | Value |
|------------------|------:|
| Conformance issues | 0 |
| Voltage sources (spec requires 1) | 1 |

| Structural integrity | Value |
|----------------------|------:|
| Reference issues | 0 |
| Dimension issues | 0 |
| Galvanic islands | 1 |
| Islands without voltage reference | 0 |
| Line impedance spread | 3150.0× |

| Benchmark readiness | Value |
|---------------------|------:|
| Objective well-posed | true |
| Only slack generation | false |
| Buses with \|V\| bounds | 0.0% |
| Buses with vpn / vpp / vpos bounds | 4079 / 0 / 0 |
| Lines with thermal limits | 100.0% |
| Generators with no DOF (p\_min≈p\_max) | 0 |
| Generators with zero cost (dispatchable) | 0 |
| Same-cost generator pairs (≤1 hop) | 0 |
| Loads with zero p\_nom | 0 |

**Augmentation needed:**

- no voltage magnitude bounds on any bus — voltage is unconstrained; add v_min/v_max (phase-to-ground)

### 🔵 Info

- **[I.PROV.NO_PI_SHUNT]** `linecode`  
  All 8 linecode(s) have no π-shunt admittance (G_from/B_from/G_to/B_to absent or zero) — the line model reduces to a series impedance only. Shunt capacitance is typically negligible for short LV cables but may be significant for long MV/HV lines.
- **[I.PROV.DSS_DEFAULT_LENGTH]** `line`  
  2 of 4079 line(s) have length exactly 1.0 among otherwise varied lengths — the OpenDSS default; these lengths were likely never set.
- **[I.PRE.NO_VOLT_BOUNDS]** `bus`  
  4080 bus(es) have no voltage bounds — voltage will be unconstrained at these buses.
- **[I.PRE.SINGLE_SOURCE]** `network`  
  Network has a single voltage source — single point of failure. Infeasibility of the source makes the entire network infeasible.
- **[I.RED.MERGEABLE_LINES]** `line`  
  365 group(s) of series lines (3815 lines total) can be merged — intermediate buses have no other connections.
